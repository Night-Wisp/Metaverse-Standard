# Metaverse-Standard
An actively updated standard for the implementation of metaverse applications

# Why?
I believe the metaverse should be open for anyone to develop or create within. It shouldn't be locked to just a couple big companies.
# What?
The best way to ensure collaboration is to have an open standard, created by the community, for creating and implementing applications for the metaverse.
